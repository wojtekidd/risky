## How to Use This Skill

When user requests creative direction (campaign, ad, video, content), follow this workflow:

### Step 1: Analyze User Requirements

Extract key information from user request:
- **Campaign type**: Product launch, brand awareness, lead gen, etc.
- **Audience**: Gen Z, Millennials, B2B, etc.
- **Industry**: SaaS, e-commerce, healthcare, etc.
- **Platform**: TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, etc.

### Step 2: Generate Creative Brief (REQUIRED)

**Always start with `--creative-brief`** to get comprehensive recommendations:

```bash
python3 .opencode/skills/creativity/scripts/search.py "<campaign_type> <audience> <industry>" --creative-brief [-c "Campaign Name"]
```

This command:
1. Searches 5 domains in parallel (style, platform, voiceover, music, reasoning)
2. Applies reasoning rules from `creative-reasoning.csv` to select best matches
3. Returns complete brief: style, platform specs, voiceover, music, effects
4. Includes anti-patterns to avoid

**Example:**
```bash
python3 .opencode/skills/creativity/scripts/search.py "SaaS product launch gen z" --creative-brief -c "App Launch Campaign"
```

### Step 3: Supplement with Detailed Searches (as needed)

After getting the creative brief, use domain searches for additional details:

```bash
python3 .opencode/skills/creativity/scripts/search.py "<keyword>" --domain <domain> [-n <max_results>]
```

**When to use detailed searches:**

| Need | Domain | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| More style options | `style` | `--domain style "minimalist luxury"` |
| Platform specs | `platform` | `--domain platform "tiktok reels"` |
| Voiceover direction | `voiceover` | `--domain voiceover "authoritative expert"` |
| Music recommendations | `music` | `--domain music "ambient electronic"` |
| Campaign guidance | `reasoning` | `--domain reasoning "e-commerce conversion"` |

### Step 4: Load Reference Details (as needed)

For detailed implementation, load relevant references:

| Reference | Content | Use When |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| [creative-styles-part1.md](references/creative-styles-part1.md) | Styles 1-25 with keywords, colors, effects | Selecting visual direction |
| [creative-styles-part2.md](references/creative-styles-part2.md) | Styles 26-55 with keywords, colors, effects | Selecting visual direction |
| [color-psychology.md](references/color-psychology.md) | Color meanings, combinations, applications | Choosing color palette |
| [voiceover-styles.md](references/voiceover-styles.md) | 5 VO categories with delivery specs | Video/audio content |
| [audio-music.md](references/audio-music.md) | Music trends, sonic branding | Video content, ads |
| [visual-trends.md](references/visual-trends.md) | 2025-26 design trends | Modern visual direction |

# Gamification Marketing

Design and implement gamified marketing campaigns using behavioral psychology and game mechanics.

## Quick Decision Tree

```
GOAL → MECHANICS
├─ Acquisition → Referral leaderboards + dual rewards + social proof
├─ Retention → Streaks + tiers + loyalty points + loss aversion
├─ Engagement → Challenges + leaderboards + badges + daily quests
├─ Conversion → Variable rewards + time-limited offers + progress bars
└─ Onboarding → Progress bars + micro-badges + unlockables
```

## Core Mechanics (10)

| Mechanic | Best For | Psychology |
|----------|----------|------------|
| Points | All goals | Achievement, progress tracking |
| Badges | Recognition, milestones | Competence, social proof |
| Leaderboards | Competition, engagement | Social comparison, status |
| Levels | Progression, retention | Mastery, unlocking content |
| Streaks | Habit formation, retention | Loss aversion, commitment |
| Challenges | Engagement, conversion | Goal-setting, achievement |
| Quests | Extended engagement | Narrative, exploration |
| Unlockables | Retention, progression | Curiosity, exclusivity |
| Rewards | All goals | Dopamine, variable schedules |
| Progress Bars | Onboarding, completion | Visual momentum, Zeigarnik |

## Workflow

1. **Identify Goal** → Use decision tree above
2. **Select Mechanics** → See [mechanics-selection.md](references/mechanics-selection.md)
3. **Align Psychology** → See [psychology-frameworks.md](references/psychology-frameworks.md)
4. **Design Campaign** → See [campaign-templates.md](references/campaign-templates.md)
5. **Implement** → See [implementation-guide.md](references/implementation-guide.md)
6. **Measure** → See [kpi-tracking.md](references/kpi-tracking.md)

## Key Stats

- Streaks: 3.6x retention at 7-day milestone (Duolingo)
- Progress bars: 40% completion lift
- Leaderboards: 40% engagement increase
- Variable rewards: Higher dopamine than fixed
- ROI: $4.90 return per $1 invested

## White Hat vs Black Hat

**White Hat (70% - long-term):** Levels, badges, achievement, community, creative expression
**Black Hat (30% - urgency):** Scarcity, time limits, loss aversion, FOMO, variable rewards

## Player Types (Bartle)

- **Achievers (10%):** Leaderboards, points, visible progress
- **Explorers (10%):** Hidden badges, easter eggs, discovery
- **Socializers (80%):** Team challenges, sharing, community
- **Killers (5-10%):** PvP, competitive rankings

## Common Pitfalls

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Too many mechanics | Pick 2-3 core; phased rollout |
| Unclear reward value | Show math: "100 pts = $5" |
| Leaderboard toxicity | Friendly framing, hide ranks below top 10 |
| Impossible challenges | Start easy, progressive difficulty |
| No personalization | Segment by player type |

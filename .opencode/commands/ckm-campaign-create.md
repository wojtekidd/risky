## Your Mission

Design a comprehensive, executable marketing campaign using discovery, ideation, strategy selection, and detailed execution planning.

## Phase 1: Discovery

Use `AskUserQuestion` to gather campaign essentials:

- Target audience: Who are we reaching? (demographics, psychographics, pain points)
- Budget range: $500-2K | $2K-10K | $10K-50K | $50K+
- Timeline: 1-2 weeks | 1 month | 2-3 months | Ongoing

**Question Set B (Context)**
- Primary channels: Paid ads | Social organic | Email | Content | Influencer | Mix
- Existing assets: Landing page | Email list | Social following | Content library
- Success metrics: What defines campaign success?
- Brand guidelines: Any constraints or requirements?

Read `docs/brand-guidelines.md` for brand context. Activate `brand-guidelines` skill.

## Phase 2: Ideation & Options

Use `brainstormer` skill to enter brainstorming session and generate 3-5 campaign concepts:

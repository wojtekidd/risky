# Referral Program Building

Build viral referral programs that drive 2-3x higher conversion rates with 37% better retention.

## Quick Start

1. **Define Program Type** - Choose reward structure matching business model
2. **Select Platform** - Pick tool based on scale and integration needs
3. **Implement Tracking** - Set up attribution, fraud prevention, analytics
4. **Launch & Optimize** - Soft launch, measure KPIs, iterate

## Core Principles

- **Two-Sided Rewards:** Both referrer AND referee get incentives (68% higher participation)
- **Product Alignment:** Use product as reward when possible (Dropbox model)
- **Integration:** Embed in user workflow, not separate feature
- **Simplicity:** Explain in 2-3 bullet points or it's too complex

### 3. Generate Logo with Gemini Nano Banana model 

**ALWAYS** generate output logo images with white background.

## Workflow Example

**User:** "Create a logo for a sustainable coffee brand called GreenBean"

1. Generate design brief:
```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/logo-design/scripts/search.py "coffee organic eco sustainable" --design-brief -p "GreenBean"
```

2. Generate logo variations:
**ALWAYS** generate output logo images with white background.

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/logo-design/scripts/generate.py --brand "GreenBean" --style vintage --industry eco
python3 ~/.claude/skills/logo-design/scripts/generate.py --brand "GreenBean" --style organic --industry food
```

1. **[FINAL STEP - REQUIRED]** Ask user about HTML preview:

After logo generation completes, **ALWAYS** use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to ask if the user wants to preview all generated logos in a single eye-catching HTML file.

**AskUserQuestion parameters:**
```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "Would you like me to create an HTML preview page for all generated logos?",
    "header": "Preview",
    "options": [
      {
        "label": "Yes, create preview (Recommended)",
        "description": "Generate a beautiful HTML gallery matching brand colors, showing all logo variants with download links"
      },
      {
        "label": "No, skip preview",
        "description": "I'll review the files directly in the output folder"
      }
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  }]
}
```

If user selects **Yes**, invoke /ui-ux-pro-max skill to create an HTML file in the output directory with:
- Brand-matching color scheme (extract from design brief or brand guidelines)
- Dark/light mode toggle
- Grid layout showcasing all logo variants
- Hover effects to enlarge logos
- Download buttons for each logo
- Responsive design for mobile viewing
- Brand name as page title

**IMPORTANT:** If there are multiple variants generated, lay them out side by side for better comparision.
